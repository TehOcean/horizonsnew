    <h3>Websites</h3>
    <p>A good website must fulfill a number of key criteria. Perhaps most importantly, the website must be stable with no bugs. If there are any bugs, its more than likely I'll close the tab and forget all about it! In a close second, I would suggest making a website easily navigatable is crucial as well; this includes using a navigational links at the top of the website. Or if the website is a bit larger - an effective search engine. Safety is also a crucial factor for websites, and I am wary of any website that does not use HTTPs.</p>
    <p>To make best use of any website, it is crucial that anyone can access it. Indeed, accessibility has been a key factor in designing this website. The website contains large text with substantial contrast between different sections of the site, as well as between text and the background. Each section is concise and contains sufficient headings for ease of navigation.</p>
    <p>This website does not collect any personal data of users nor does it use cookies; thus it is not necessary to contain GDPR information. However, if were to start taking orders for our unit or start a mailing list, we would be required to write a privacy notice to become GDPR compliant. The first step in writing a privacy notice is to note down the contact details of your company, a step which we have already done. The next part of the privacy statement requires that you write about the specific types of personal data you collect. Then you write the legal basis for collecting this data and how your company processes this data. Finally, you must state how long this data will be kept for, and the individual rights of each type of data. These might include the right to be forgotten or the right of users to request a copy of the information a company holds on them.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the first step in increasing traffic to the website is effective search engine optimization (SEO). This is a technique used to increase the ranking of your website in search engines; an example being using keywords on your website pages. Once your website is well optimized you could use social media advertising to attract more users to your site. Indeed, having a strong social media presence is a good step to increasing the traffic to your site. However, above all else, it is crucial that your website has good content! Without good content, no one is going to want to visit your website.</p>
    <p>If we were to launch this product commercially, a number of steps would have to be taken to ensure the site is useable for users. The first step would be to ue some sort of ecommerce platform, such as <a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/">Shopify</a>. Indeed, the use of an ecommerce platform would require a GDPR Privacy Note, as described above. To make the product more appealing, I would likely work on making the product page more detailed, with specifications such as dimensions and weight of the product. I would also like to add more photos to the site, although at this early stage in prototyping little content has been generated.
